Elastic File System (EFS)

Managed NFS (Network File System) that can be mounted on multiple EC2s (unlike EBS).
EFS can work with EC2 in multi AZ.
Highly available, scalable, expensive, pay per use.
Use case:
	content management
	web serving
	data sharing
	Wordpress
Uses NFSv4.1 protocol.
Uses security group to control access to EFS.
Performance modes:
	General purpose (default)
	Max I/O used then thousands of EC2 are using EFS
EFS file sync to sync from on-premise file system to EFS.
Backup EFS-to-EFS (incremental can chose frequency).
Encryption at rest using KMS (like EBS)
