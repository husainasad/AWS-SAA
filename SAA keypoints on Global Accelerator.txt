AWS Global Accelerator
	Unicast IP: one server holds one IP address
	Anycast IP: all servers hold the same IP address and client is routed to the nearest one


	Leverage the AWS internal network to route to the application
	Anycast IPs are created for the application
	The Anycast IP send traffic directly to Edge locations
	The edge locations send the traffic to the application

Works with Elastic IP, EC2 instance, ALB, NLB, public or private
Consistent Performance
	Intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover
	No issue with client cache
	Internal AWS network
Health Checks
	Global Accelerator performs health checks on the applications
	Helps make applications global (failover <1 minute for unhealthy)
	Great for disaster recovery
Security
	only external IPs need to be whitelisted
	DDoS protection from AWS shield

AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
Both use AWS global network and edge locations
Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection

CloudFront
	Improves performance for cacheable content (images/videos)
	Improves performance for dynamic content (API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
	Content is served at edge
AWS Global Accelerator
	Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
	Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS regions
	Good fit for non HTTP use cases such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP
	Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
	Good for HTTP use cases that require deterministic, fast regional failover
