Amazon Aurora

Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced).
Postgre and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB.
Aurora is 'AWS optimized' giving better performance than MySQl or Postgres.
Aurora storage automatically increments.
Aurora can have much more replicas than other (MySQL/Postgres) and replication process is faster.
Failover is instantaneous since it is HA native.
Aurora costs more but is much more efficient.

Aurora Features
	Automatica fail over
	Backup and Recovery
	Isolation and Security
	Industry compliance
	Push button scaling
	Automated patching with zero downtime
	Advanced Monitoring
	Routinge maintenance
	Backtrack: restore data from an point of time without using backtracks

Aurora  Security (same as RDS)
	Uses same engines (so same security)
	Encryption at rest using KMS
	Automated backups, snapshots and rpelicas also encrypted
	Encryption in flight using SSL
	Possibilty to authenticate using IAM token
	User cannot SSH

Aurora Serverless
	Automated database instantiation and auto scaling based on actual usage.
	Good for infrequent, intermittent or unpredicatable workloads.
	No capacity planning needed.
	Pay per second (can be more cost efective)

Global Aurora
	Aurora Cross region read replicas
		useful for disaster recovery
		simple to put in place
	Aurora Globla Database (recommended)
		1 primary region (read/write)
		upto 5 secondary (read/write) regions, replication lag is <1 second
		upto 16 read replicas per secondary region
		helps in decreasing latency
		promoting another region (for disaster decovery) has recovery time objective (RTO) of <1 minute
