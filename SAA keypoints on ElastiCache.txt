AWS ELastiCache

ElastiCache is a service for managed cache just like RDS is to get managed relational databases.
Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance and low latency.
This helps in reducing load off of databases for read intensive workloads.
Helps in making applications stateless.
Write scaling using sharding.
Read scaling using replicas.
Multi AZ with failover capacity.
AWS takes care of OS maintenance/patching, optimizations, setup, configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups.

ElastiCache Redis

Multi AZ with auto failover.
Read replicas to sclae reads and have high availability.
Data durability using AOF persistence.
Backup and restore features.

ElastiCache MemCached

High performance, distributed memory object caching system intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications.
Multinode for partitioning of data (sharding).
Non persistent.
No backup and restore.
Multi threaded architecture.

ElastiCache - Cache Security

All caches in ElastiCache:
	Support SSL in flight encryption
	Do not support IAM authentication
	IAM policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API level security
Redis AUTH
	User can create a password/token when creating redis cluster
	AUTH is an extra level of security on top of secuity groups
Memcached
	Supports SASL based authentication

Patterns for ElastiCache
	Lazy loading: all read data is cached, data can become stale in cache.
	Write through: Adds or updates data in cache when written to DB (no stale state).
	Session store: store temporary session data in a cache (TTL).
