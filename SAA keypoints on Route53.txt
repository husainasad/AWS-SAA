Route53

It is a managed Domain Name System (DNS).
DNS is a collection of rules and records which help clients understand how to reach a server through URLs.
The most common records are:
	A: URL to IPv4
	AAAA: URL to IPv6
	CNAME: URL to URL
	Alias: URL to AWS resource

Route53 can use:
	public domain names you own (or buy)
	private domain names that can be resolved by your instances in your VPCs

Route53 features
	Global service
	Load balancing (through DNS - also called client load balancing)
	Limited health checks
	Routing policies: simple, failover, geolocation, latency, weighted, multi value

Route 53 is not free

DNS Records TTL (Time to Live)

TTL is a way for browsers and client to cache the response of a DNS query.
This is done is to not to overload the DNS.
High TTL
	Less traffic on DNS
	Possibly outdated records
Low TTL
	More traffic on DNS
	Records are not outdated for long
	Records are easy to change

CNAME
	Points a URL to another URL
	Only for Non Root Domain (can be *something*.*somedomain*.com but not directly *somedomain*.com)
ALIAS
	Points a URL to AWS resource
	Works for Root and Non Root Domain
	Free of charge
	Native health checks

Simple Routing Policy
	Maps a domain to one URL
	Use when you need to redirect to a single resource
	health checks cannot be attached
	If multiple values are returned, a random one is chosen by the client server
	Client server is aware of different IPs

Weighted Routing Policy
	Controls the % of the requests that go to a specific endpoint
	Helpful to test 1% of traffic on new application version
	Helpful to split traffic between two regions
	Can be associated with health checks
	Client server unaware of different IPs

Latency Routing Policy
	Redirect to server that has the least latency close to client server
	Helpful when latency of user is priority

Health Checks
	If X health checks fail in a row => unhealthy (default 3)
	If X health checks pass in a row => healthy (default 3)
	Default health check interval: 30s
	About 15 health checkers check the enpoint health
	Can have HTTP, TCP, and HTTPS health checks (no SSL verification)
	Health checks can be integrated with CloudWatch
	Health checks can be linked to Route53 DNS queries

Failover Routing Policy
	Primary instance with mandatory health check
	Secondary instance for disaster recovery (health check not mandatory)
	If primary instance is unhealthy, client is directed to secondary instance

Geo location Routing Policy
	Different from latency based
	Based on user location
	Also creates a default policy for unmatched user addresses

Mulit Value Routing Policy
	Use when routing traffic to multiple resources
	Want to associate health checks with records
	Upto 8 healthy records are returned for each Mulit Value query
	Multi value is not a substitiute for ELB
	Client server aware of different IPs

Route53 as a Registrar

A domain name registrar is an organisation that manages the reservation of Internet domain names
