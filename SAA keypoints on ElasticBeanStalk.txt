ElasticBeanStalk 
It is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS.
It uses all the different components (EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, etc).
All the components are in one view which is easy to make sense of.
Developer has full control over the configuration.
BeanStalk is free, only the underlying resources are charged.

It is a managed service
	Instance configuration/OS is handled by beanstalk
	Deployment strategy is configurable but performed by ElasticBeanStalk

Just the application code is the responsibility of the developer.

Three architecture models:
	Single Instance deployment: good for dev
	LB + ASG: great for production or pre-production web applications
	ASG only: great for non-web apps in production

ElasticBeanStalk has three components
	Application
	Application version
	Environment name

Developer can deploy the application to environments and can promote application versions to the next environment.
Rollback feature to previous application version.
Full control over lifecycle of environments.
