Scalability means that an application/system can handle greater loads by adapting.
There are two types of scalability:
	Vertical scalability
	Horizontal scalability (elasticity)

Scalability is linked but different to high availability.

Vertical scalability means increasing the size of the instance.
Vertical scalability is very common for non distributed systems such as database.
RDS, ElastiCache can scale vertically.
There is a hardware limit on how much user can vertically scale.

Horizontal scalability means increasing number of instances/systems for the application.
Horizontal scalability implies distributed systems.
Horizontal scalability is common for web applications.

High availability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling.
High availability means running the application in atleast 2 different data centers (availability zones).
The goal here is to survive data center loss.
